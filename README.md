Access deltaDNA's analytics and SmartAds platforms from Unity.

### Installation

Our analytics SDK is written entirely in Unity with no native code requirements.  Out of the box it runs on any platform that Unity supports.  The easiest way to get started is to download the `deltadna-sdk-*.unitypackage` from this repository, and import into your Unity project.

### Quick Start

For all the information on how to use the SDK, refer to our documentation [portal](http://docs.deltadna.com/advanced-integration/unity-sdk/).

### SmartAds

Integrating SmartAds into your Unity project requires native code extensions which we supply separately.  More information on how to access our SmartAds platform is [here](http://docs.deltadna.com/advanced-integration/smart-ads/).  To add the Unity extensions download and import the `deltadna-smartads-*.unitypackage`.
